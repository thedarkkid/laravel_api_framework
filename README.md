## Laravel Api Framework
This is a framework of basic things you would need to set up a Laravel REST API.
If you get an error when trying to `composer install` that reads:
```bash
PackageManifest.php line 131:
 Undefined index: name
```
You can try running the following commands to fix:
```bash 
rm -rf composer.lock // removes composer.lock
rm -rf vendor // removes vendor folder
composer install // re-runs composer install
```
